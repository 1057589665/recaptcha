#labels Phase-Requirements

=2.8=
===Short Term===
  * Integrate Mailhide
    ** Remove unnecessary options. *Done*
    ** Don't describe MailHide; give an example. Link to the [http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/ user] page instead. *Done*
    ** Don't show CSS or Regex as options in the admin panel. Show the CSS class for hidden emails on the admin page. *Done*
    ** Check for mcrypt PHP module: We can use *extension_loaded*. Show an alert of this on the admin page. *Done*
    {{{
    if (extension_loaded('mcrypt'))
    }}}
  * Option to turn off reCAPTCHA for admins
  * What of <a href="me@haha.com">Email Me</a>
  * Fix the Akismet conflicts: WordPress Hook priority level problems?
  * Use WordPress Plugins database to make use of WordPress plugin update notifications
  * A way to bypass the MailHide filter. Something like {{{[nomailhide][/nomailhide]}}}. Should be possible with another regular expression.
  * Make XSS-proof. Apostrophes are allowed in email matching regex for MailHide, can it be used to escape out of Javascript.
===Long Term===
  * Integrate with Akismet. If Akismet says comment is okay, then bypass reCAPTCHA, else, give another chance with reCAPTCHA: Might be possible with Akismet API given Akismet conflicts are fixed
  * Karma model. If, based on karma model, user can be trusted, don't show reCAPTCHA to them.
  * XHTML 1.0 Transistional compliant
